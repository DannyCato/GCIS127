What happens when you change the amount of time that the turnip dropper waits between drops? What if you reduce it to 0? Why do you think that is?
    The closer to 10 i put the timing, the more even the distribution was between Threads, but if i put it to 1 or 0 then it would go back
    At 0, it likes to mess up the printing to the console, but it still seems to work correctly
    I have no idea. Maybe the thread that might be fastest is being outrun by the turnipDropper thread and is allowing other threads to enter
    
What happens if you change the number of turnips that are dropped at a time to a higher number, e.g. 5 or 10? Why do you think that is?
    When i change the number to higher number, the distribution becomes more uneven. The goat that would normally have the most has significantly more if not all the turnips
    The faster thread is being given a larger share of the pie and there are less iterations overall so it loses some of its distributing abilities
